# LaTeX Files Repository
This repo contains just about anything that I'm doing within a LaTeX environment.

The files contained within the `custom` folder are files that I've included in my environment using `texmf`. These are generally just classes that I found on the internet or created myself that I would use for things like homework assignments, lab reports, etc.

I'm personally using MiKTeX, however you may use whatever makes you happy. So long as it compiles LaTeX, it should be usable. I feel as though MiKTeX does a great job at managing packages (espcially `texmf`), and that's why I use it.
