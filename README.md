# LaTeX Files Repository
This repo contains just about anything that I'm doing within a LaTeX environment.

I also have a couple files within the `C:\texmf\` directory, specifically Jake Zimmerman's homework document class.
This can be cloned to your drive by doing `git clone https://github.com/jez/latex-homework-class.git`. Read the documentation here: https://blog.jez.io/2015/01/10/the-latex-homework-document-class/

I'm personally using MiKTeX, however you may use whatever makes you happy. So long as it compiles LaTeX, it should be usable. I feel as though MiKTeX does a great job at managing packages (espcially `texmf`), and that's why I use it.
